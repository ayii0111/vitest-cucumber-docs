## Ignore Rule / Scenario with Gherkin tags

`describeFeature` allows optional options to ignore `Scenario`, `Scenario Outline`, `Rule` according to a tag.

~~~gherkin
Feature: detect uncalled rules
    @awesome
    Scenario: Me I am executed
        Given vitest-cucumber is running
        Then I am executed
    @another-tag
    Rule: executed rule
        Scenario: I am also executed
            Given vitest-cucumber is running
            Then  my parent rule is called
        @custom
        Scenario: Ignored scenario
            Given vitest-cucumber is running
            Then  I am ignored
~~~

Here is an example to ignore the Rule by exluding the tag `@another-tag`: 

~~~typescript
describeFeature(feature, () => {
    // ...
}, { excludeTags : ['another-tag']}) // you can use as many tags as you want
~~~

This will ignore `Rule` and its `Scenario` / `Scenario Outline`.

## Nesting tags filtering

Since `3.10.0` vitest-cucumber allows to use nested tags with `includeTags`, `excludeTags` in `describeFeature` or [configuration](/configuration).

Example:

~~~typescript
describeFeature(feature, () => {
    // ...
}, { 
    excludeTags : [
        ["alpha", "beta"], 
        "vitests", 
        "another"
    ]
})
~~~

It will exclude `Rule`, `Scenario` etc with (`@alpha` and `@beta`) tags or `@vitests` or `@another` tag.
