title: Rule
description: vitest-cucumber goals

**Note**: if you have `Scenario` / `Scenario Outline` in your feature file but not inside a rule, they should be ordered before `Rule`.

For example, if you write a feature like this: 

~~~gherkin
Feature: Run tests with Rule
    Rule: I've specific Scenario
        Scenario: I'm rule's scenario
            Given I use vitest-cucumber
            Then  It know I come from a Rule
    Scenario: I'm feature's scenario
        Given I use vitest-cucumber
        Then  It know I come from a Feature
~~~

Be careful, **vitest-cucumber** does not use indentation.
So, in this case *I'm feature's scenario* `Scenario` is also executed within the `Rule`.

## Rule example

`Rule` is like a `Feature`, you can declare the scenarios and their steps.

~~~javascript
describeFeature(feature, ({Rule}) => {
    Rule(`rule with scenarii`, ({RuleScenario, RuleScenarioOutline}) => {
        RuleScenario(`rule scenario`, ({Given, When, Then}) => {
            Given(``, () => {})
            When(``, () => {})
            Then(``, () => {})
        })
        RuleScenarioOutline(`rule scenario outline`, ({Given, When, Then, And}) => {
            Given(``, () => {})
            When(``, () => {})
            Then(``, () => {})
            And(``, () => {})
        })
    })
})
~~~

## Hooks

If you set hooks `BeforeEachScenario` and/or `AfterEachScenario` inside `describeFeature`.
They will be used in your rule(s) scenario(s).
