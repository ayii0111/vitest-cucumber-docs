title: Hooks
description: vitest-cucumber goals
---

**vitest-cucumber** provides some hooks based on existing Vitest hooks like `beforeAll`,
`afterAll`, etc.

All hooks are optional.

~~~typescript
describeFeature(feature, ({ 
    AfterAllScenarios, AfterEachScenario, BeforeAllScenarios, BeforeEachScenario, Scenario
}) => {
    BeforeAllScenarios(() => { })
    BeforeEachScenario(() => { })
    AfterEachScenario(() => { })
    AfterAllScenarios(() => { })
})
~~~

## BeforeAllScenarios

`BeforeAllScenarios` is run once when `describeFeature` is executed at the start. 
It's like a `beforeAll`.

## AfterAllScenarios

`AfterAllScenarios` is like `afterAll`. It is called when all `Scenario` and/or `ScenarioOutline` are finished.

## BeforeEachScenario

`BeforeEachScenario` is like `beforeEach`.
It is called before each `Scenario` and/or `ScenarioOutline` from `rule` or `feature`.

But `BeforeEachScenario` is not called after each `Background`.

`Background` can be considered like `BeforeEachScenario` but following Gherkin syntax with steps EventCounts.

### AfterEachScenario

`AfterEachScenario` is like `afterEach` for each `Scenario` and/or `ScenarioOutline` from `rule` or `feature`.

`AfterEachScenario` is not called after each `Background`. 

Is called before each `Scenario` and/or `Scenario` + `Background` "couple".
