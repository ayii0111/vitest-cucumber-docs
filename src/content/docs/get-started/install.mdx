To install **vitest-cucumber**: 

~~~bash
npm install @amiceli/vitest-cucumber --save-dev
~~~

It is that simple, you don't need to create a configuration file or to update the *Vitest* config.

## Run tests

Underneath, **vitest-cucumber** uses *Vitest* functions like `describe`, `test`, etc. 

Now you can run Vitest the way you want, see: 

~~~bash
vitest --run --coverage
~~~

### Dependencies

Since `3.4.4`, vitest-cucumber requires `Vitest` to be `>=2.0.0`.
