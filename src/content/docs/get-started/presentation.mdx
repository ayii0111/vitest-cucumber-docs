## About vitest-cucumber

[vitest-cucumber](https://github.com/amiceli/vitest-cucumber) is an **opiniated** tool 
to write acceptance tests following the Gherkin syntax,
designed to be used specifically with [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/).

This package was originally inspirated by [jest-cucumber](https://github.com/bencompton/jest-cucumber).

## Example

A Gherkin `Feature` is written in a `.feature` file. Example: 

~~~gherkin
# example.feature
Feature: use vitest-cucumber with vitest
    Scenario: Run unit tests
        Given I have installed vitest-cucumber
        And   I have a feature like "example.feature"
        When  I run vitest-cucumber
        Then  My feature file is parsed
        And   I can test my scenarios
~~~

You can then use it with **vitest-cucumber**: 

~~~ts
// example-feature.spec.ts
import { loadFeature, describeFeature } from '@amiceli/vitest-cucumber'

const feature = await loadFeature('./example.feature')

describeFeature(feature, ({ Scenario }) => {
    Scenario('Run unit tests', ({ Given, When, Then, And }) => {
        Given('I have installed vitest-cucumber', () => {})
        And('I have a feature like "example.feature"', () => {})
        When('I run vitest-cucumber', () => {})
        Then('My feature file is parsed', () => {})
        And('I can test my scenarios', () => {})
    })
})
~~~
